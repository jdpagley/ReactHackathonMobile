# FigNewton
A smart way to view and save gifs

## The Team
* Josh Pagley
* Jeremy Pagley
* Brandy Bergh
* Kelly Rhodes

## The Concept
After you log in, you'll be able to see categories of gifs.  Pick one, pick two!  Gifs matching those categories will be shown to you randomly.  You can choose to Love it or Leave it...those gifs will then be saved to your profile page as likes or dislikes.

## Yo, where the money at?
Sponsored gifs!  I know I would like a gif from Taco Bell, right?  We could also follow the freemium model -- folks could pay for premium packages of gifs to add to their library.

## Bribe for Judges
We made sure to include a goat category of gifs, just sayin'.

## Wanna play?
1. git clone https://github.com/jdpagley/ReactHackathonMobile.git
2. npm install
3. react-native start
4. react-native run-ios

Open up Xcode, build it, and have fun!
